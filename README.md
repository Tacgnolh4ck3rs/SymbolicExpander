# SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION EXPANDER

Have you ever had the need to expand a symbolic expression without using a GUI? (I'm looking at you MatLab)
Have you ever needed to do it just in your terminal with a rough and possibly not that good implementation? Well, look no more, you've reached the thing you're looking for.

Introducing a command-line approach to your needs, possibly not optimised, and with a metric f-ton of bugs (to be determined).

All you need to do is input a JSON file with your un-expanded expressions and et voil√†, this approach will return the expanded version of those (so called) expressions!
And that's it.
